Question 1
==========
Create a data file in which you place 20 DNA sequences (each of size between 30 and 50 nucleotides). Write a program to read the sequences and builds a 1-D list of the sequences. The program then builds a 2-D list to store the number of each nucleotide in each sequence (in the form of a table, as shown below). The last column of the table should contain the total length of the sequence. It then displays all sequences in the 1-D list, followed by the 2-D list as a table.
