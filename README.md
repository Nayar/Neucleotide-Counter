Question 1
==========
Create a data file in which you place 20 DNA sequences (each of size between 30 and 50 nucleotides). Write a program to read the sequences and builds a 1-D list of the sequences. The program then builds a 2-D list to store the number of each nucleotide in each sequence (in the form of a table, as shown below). The last column of the table should contain the total length of the sequence. It then displays all sequences in the 1-D list, followed by the 2-D list as a table. 

Question 2
==========
The molecular masses of the different nucleotides are given below.  Make a copy of the program in question 1 and modify it so as to use the 2-D list to calculate the molecular mass of each sequence. The program should then write each sequence and its corresponding molecular mass into a file. It should also find the average, highest and lowest molecular masses. At the end of the file, it should write the average molecular mass, the sequences of highest and lowest molecular masses and, in each case, write also the corresponding molecular mass
